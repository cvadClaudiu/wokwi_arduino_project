Simple arduino app, made on the wokwi simulator, using an ili9341 display, a motion sensor, a stepper motor, an RGB LED and an IR remote
The app starts spinning a stepper motor when motion is detected from the senzor. Additionally, the stepper can be triggered manually, as well as configured by using the IR remote.
The RGB LED changes color depending on what action the app is currently performing
